Swift is not that like Go, though.
Especially for the Object Oriented Programming part.

It's not finished yet since I don't some syntaxs of them.

### Better one

Yes, there is a better one on **Hyperpolyglot**:

C, Go, Swift: a side-by-side reference sheet http://hyperpolyglot.org/c

### Develop

For it to add yours.

```
npm i # install dependencies to build tools
./make.coffee dev # build html
```

HTML is generated from `cirru/index.cirru`.
Read that file and you would know what's happening.
